MySQL is a Relational Database Management System, or RDBMS. This means it stores data in tables and creates relationships between the data in the different tables.

We use the Structured Query Language (SQL) to interact with MySQL. SQL is made up of statements and commands sent to the server individually, with results sent back to the client.


These are the commands that create and define structures within MySQL.
Data Definition Language (DDL)
Data Control Language (DCL) commands.

Later, we will get into Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Query Language (DQL).

Check the status of the server
mysql.server status

Start the server
mysql.server start


MySQL server understands Structured Query Language (SQL) commands, stores and organizes the data on disk, and users that can connect and manipulate the data.

MySQL client that connects to the server for us, sends our commands to the server, and displays the data on screen.

This instructs the MySQL client to connect to the MySQL server using the specified user, and a password. After successfully logging in, we should be greeted by the server:

We can connect to the MySQL server with the following command:
mysql -u USERNAME -p
